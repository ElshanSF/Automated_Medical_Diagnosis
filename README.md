# Automated_Medical_Diagnosis
In this problem, we are going to build a model to diagnose heart disease. 

The training set is provided in the file ``dataset_3_train.txt`` and there are two test sets: ``dataset_3_test_1.txt`` and ``dataset_3_test_2.txt``. Each patient in the datasets is described by 5 biomarkers extracted from cardiac SPECT images; the last column in each dataset contains the disease diagnosis (1 indicates that the patient is normal, and 0 indicates that the patient suffers from heart disease).
